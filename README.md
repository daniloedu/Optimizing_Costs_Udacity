# Optimizing_Costs_Udacity
Jupyter Notebook to optimize the code for a E-commerce Udacity.

Your online gift store has one million users that each listed a gift on a wishlist. You have the prices for each of these gifts stored in `gift_costs.txt`. For the holidays, you're going to give each customer their wishlist gift for free if the cost is under $25. Now, you want to calculate the total cost of all gifts under $25 to see how much you'd spend on free gifts.

Download the notebook file `optimizing_code_holiday_gifts.ipynb` and the `gift_costs.txt` file. Open the notebook file using the Jupyter Notebook.
