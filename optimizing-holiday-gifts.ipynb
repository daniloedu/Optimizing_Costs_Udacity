Let's use these tips for one more example.\n\nSay your online gift store has one million users that each listed a gift on a wish list. You have the prices for each of these gifts stored in `gift_costs.txt`. For the holidays, you're going to give each customer their wish list gift for free if it is under 25 dollars. Now, you want to calculate the total cost of all gifts under 25 dollars to see how much you'd spend on free gifts. Here's one way you could've done it.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import time\nimport numpy as np","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-10T02:08:09.626766Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-10T02:08:09.627205Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-10T02:08:09.638378Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-10T02:08:09.627106Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-10T02:08:09.637661Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"with open('../input/giftcoststxt/gift-costs.txt') as f:\n    gift_costs = f.read().split('\\n')\n    \ngift_costs = np.array(gift_costs).astype(int)  # convert string to int","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-10T02:08:38.243007Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-10T02:08:38.243564Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-10T02:08:48.108930Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-10T02:08:38.243511Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-10T02:08:48.108037Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"start = time.time()\n\ntotal_price = 0\nfor cost in gift_costs:\n    if cost < 25:\n        total_price += cost * 1.08  # add cost after tax\n\nprint(total_price)\nprint('Duration: {} seconds'.format(time.time() - start))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-10T02:09:16.069236Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-10T02:09:16.069609Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-10T02:09:32.749822Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-10T02:09:16.069577Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-10T02:09:32.749084Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"32765421.23999867\nDuration: 16.67508029937744 seconds\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here you iterate through each cost in the list, and check if it's less than 25.
